### Moin ! 🙋‍♂️

My name is David, a  embedded & web developer based in Germany.

A builder at heart, turning imagination into interactive reality.

If I come up with something cool, chances are I will build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is c\c++, python,  and javascript. My favourite tools are VS-Code, Cmake and Postman.

I have build over 80 public repos, but if I count the privet ones .. Its probably, more than 100 at this point.

I have a lot of pinned projects, but my favourite one is currently the [Ethereum-Tracker](https://github.com/Dave200s1/Ethereum-Tracker).

#### Fun Facts:
* I am a college student (Major: Media informatics)
* Attack on Titan is my favourite anime
* Hobbies: chess, playing guitar  and building things
