### Moin ! 🙋‍♂️

My name is David, I am a web developer based in Germany 🇩🇪.

A builder at heart, turning imagination into interactive reality.

If something sparks my interest, I’ll build it and share it.

Whilst I work across the full stack, my main focus is backend development — designing clean architectures, APIs, and scalable systems.

### My main tech stack is 
#### Backend (Primary Focus)
* C# / ASP.NET
* Node.js / Express.js.
#### Frontend
* React / JavaScript

My favourite tools are VS-Code, Co-Pilot and Insomnia.

Built 100+ projects, with 20 public here. The rest were experiments and iterations that shaped my current technical focus.

I have a lot of pinned projects, but my favourite one is currently the [KlinikAPI](https://github.com/Dave200s1/Klinik_API).

#### Fun Facts:
* I am a college student (major: media informatics)
* Attack on Titan is my favourite anime
* Hobbies: chess, playing guitar  and building things
